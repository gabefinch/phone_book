#Phonebook
This is a small Sinatra website that allows the user to create contacts and save multiple phone numbers to a single contact.  Styling is entirely bootstrap. 
Created in a few hours for an assesment at the Epicodus programming school.

To setup, run bundler in the project directory, then run the app.rb file with Ruby. The form then be found on "localhost:4567/". Enjoy!
